### User Story
This application will take the user's location as input (either picked up by the browser or taken in by text input) and cross-reference that input with older data related with a model that will determine the best response time of a service (UBER/LYFT/NYC TAXI), thus helping the user choose which service will be the best option by comparison with the weather conditions.
